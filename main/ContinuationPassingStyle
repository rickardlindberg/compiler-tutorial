main.ContinuationPassingStyle

Continuation passing style is a style of programming in which functions never
return. Instead they keep calling functions.

Let's look at a simple example: addition. A function that adds two numbers
might look like this:

    def add(first, second):
        return first + second

And you might use the function like this:

    result = add(4, 5)

This is how most languages work. But in continuation passing style, we can't
return the result. Instead we need to pass an extra function to add (known as
the continuation) to take the result and do something with it:

    def add(first, second, k):
        k(first + second)

And we might use it like this:

    def handle_result(result):
        ...

    add(4, 5, handle_result)

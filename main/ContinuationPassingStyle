main.ContinuationPassingStyle

Continuation passing style is a style of programming in which functions never
return. Instead they keep calling functions.

Let's look at a simple example: addition. A function that adds two numbers
might look like this:

    def add(first, second):
        return first + second

And you might use the function like this:

    result = add(4, 5)

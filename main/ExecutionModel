main.ExecutionModel

Before we can transform the parse tree to the target language, we need to
understand the execution model of the source program. Let's look at an example:

    let fac = \(n, k) -> facIter n 1 k

    let fac = \(n, k) -> facIter n 1 k

    let facIter = \(n, result, k) ->
        isZero n
            (\() -> k result)
            (\() -> minus n 1
                (\(n2) -> facIter n2 partial2 k))

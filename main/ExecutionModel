main.ExecutionModel

Before we can transform the parse tree to the target language, we need to
understand the execution model of the source program. Let's look at an example:

    let fac = \(n, k) ->
        facAccumulate n 1 k

    let facAccumulate = \(n, result, k) ->
        isZero n
            (\() -> k result)
            (\() ->
                minus n 1 \(newN) ->
                times n result \(newResult) ->
                facAccumulate newN newResult k)

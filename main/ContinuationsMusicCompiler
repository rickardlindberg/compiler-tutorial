main.ContinuationsMusicCompiler

In this tutorial, we are going to write a compiler that enables us to program
an ArduinoUno in our custom language that we will call ACon.

ACon is a general-purpose programming language based on
ContinuationPassingStyle. We will implement primitives to control a set of
PiezoSpeakers connected to the Arduino.

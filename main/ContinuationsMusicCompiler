main.ContinuationsMusicCompiler

In this tutorial, we are going to write a compiler that enables us to program
an ArduinoUno in our custom language that we will call *con*.

![The **con** **c**ompiler.]($ROOT/static/images/acon-compiler.png)

Con is a general-purpose programming language based on
ContinuationPassingStyle. We will implement primitives to control a set of
PiezoSpeakers connected to the Arduino.

The goal is to be able to compose music in con and have it play on the Arduino
as shown in the video below.

Now that we've implemented the C runtime in RuntimeSupport and the generation
of C code in CodeGeneration, it's time to assemble all files with avr-gcc.

The easiest way to do this is with the [Arduino
IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/software).

The files we need to assemble are:

* Runtime files (`runtime.h`, `runtime.cpp`)
* The compiled con file (`con_program.cpp`)
* A sketch file ([`sketch.pde`](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/compiler-tutorial/blob/master/src/runtime/sketch.pde))

The
[compile.sh](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/compiler-tutorial/blob/master/src/compile.sh)
script in the reference implementation collects all these files into a
directory called `sketch` and then opens the Arduino IDE that can be used to
compile all files and upload the program to the Arduino.

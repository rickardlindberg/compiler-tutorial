main.ConcOverview

The con compiler (conc) is quite simple and has only three stages.

In the first stage we have the con source code. That gets transformed into a
parse tree. Since con is a quite simple language, there is no need for extra
stages. So from the parse tree, we can generate the target code directly. In
the case of the con compiler, it is C source code. So the con compiler
transforms con source code to C source code.

In order to make the generated C source code run on the Arduino, we have to
compiler it with a C compiler.

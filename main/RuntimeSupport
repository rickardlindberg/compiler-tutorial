main.RuntimeSupport

![C runtime.]($ROOT/static/images/runtime.png)

Now that we've figured out the ExecutionModel of con, we need to implement a C
library that compiled con programs can use.

## Parts

The C runtime support library must contain the following:

* Data structure for environments
* Data structure for argument list
* Data structure for closures
* Data structures for primitive types such as numbers
* Implementation of built-in functions

### Environment

### Arguments

### Closures

### Primitives

### Built-ins

## Garbage collection

* TODO

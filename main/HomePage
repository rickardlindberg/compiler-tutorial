In this tutorial we are going to write a compiler. We will write the compiler
in Haskell (HaskellLanguage) with some supporting code in C.

As we will discover in this tutorial, implementing a compiler for a small
language is not that complicated.

A reference implementation of the compiler is available on github:
[https://github.com/rickardlindberg/compiler-tutorial/tree/master/src](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/compiler-tutorial/tree/master/src).
If at any time you feel stuck or feel that the descriptions on the wiki are not
enough, feel free to check out the code on github. The goal with this tutorial
is to teach you how to write this compiler.

main.StructureOfCompiler

A compiler is usually written by doing a sequence of transformations to the
source program until the target program is obtained.

The first step is usually parsing which transforms the source text into a
ParseTree. A parse tree is much easier to work with than strings. The last
stage generates the target program from some internal representation.

Transforming source text into target text without any intermediate steps is not
always trivial and is therefore avoided:

Different compilers have different stages. More complex compilers have more
stages. Follow along to see what stages we are going to implement in the con
compiler.

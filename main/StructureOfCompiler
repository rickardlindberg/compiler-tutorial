A compiler is usually written by doing a sequence of transformations to the
source program until the target program is obtained.

The first step is usually parsing which transforms the source text to a
ParseTree. A ParseTree is much easier to work with than strings. The last stage
generates the target program from some internal representation.

Transforming source text into target text without any intermediate steps is not
always trivial and is therefore avoided:

Different compilers have different stages. More complex compilers have more
stages. Follow along to see what stages are involved in the compiler for this
tutorial.
